Welcome to an example podcast. 

I'm Terry Morris, the author of your textbook.

If this were an actual podcast it would focus on a topic and perhaps include an interview with an interesting guest.

It's very easy to create a podcast.

If you use a Mac computer, try ou the pre-installed Garageband application.

If you are using Windows, you can download Audacity. It's a free audio recorder and editor.

Have fun creating your own podcast!
