Greetings Students & Instructors!

I encountered an odd Quicktime/Firefox 3/Windows issue during work on this chapter when using the object element to configure audio and video on a Web page. 

Firefox 3 would not start the Quicktime plug-in when displaying a .html file from a local drive. 

However, Firefox 3 WOULD access Quicktime succesfully once the same file (and media file) were published to the Web. 
Firefox 3 on the Mac always functioned perfectly. 

Just wanted to make you aware of a quirky issue. 

Best regards,
Terry Morris
