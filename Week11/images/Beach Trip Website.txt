I have chosen four beach destinations for my ideal trip because the sun makes me happy and I love going to the beach. It was virtually impossible to pick only 4 great beach destinations for my trip, but I think this trip will give me a good idea of the different beaches in the world. 
These destinations are great places to disappear with a towel, lots of sunscreen, and a good book for a memorable and relaxing vacation. Enjoy!

Pink Sands Beach 
Pink Sands Beach is located on Harbour Island in the Bahamas and is named for its pink colored sand. The three miles of blushing sand gets its color from the shells of microscopic sea animals known as Foraminifera. Its exotic resorts boast luxurious hospitality that lures stars such as Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams. Harbour Island also features one of the world’s best dive sites known as “Current Cut Dive.”
